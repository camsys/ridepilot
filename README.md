Ridepilot Verson 2
================

The purpose of this project is to implement a Computer Aided Scheduling and Dispatch (CASD) software system to meet the needs of small scale human service transportation agencies. RidePilot, an open source, web-based scheduling, reporting, and dispatch application developed by Ride Connection in Portland Oregon, was identified to fill this need. Utah Transit Authority is participating in a joint software development project ([Ridepilot Version 2](https://ridepilot.camsys-apps.com)) to build upon RidePilotâ€™s current functionality ([Ridepilot Version 1](https://github.com/rideconnection/ridepilot)) and expand it to meet the needs of human service agencies in the Wasatch Front region.
